Academic Research Copilot: a weekly auto-updating research assistant that ingests arXiv papers, creates structured summaries (problem / method / results / limitations) and runs graph-based reasoning + LLM-driven hypothesis generation on top of a RAG pipeline (LangChain). Local model inference via Ollama + HuggingFace embeddings for search.
